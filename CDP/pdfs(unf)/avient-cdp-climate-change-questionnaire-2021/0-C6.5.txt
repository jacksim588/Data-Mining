were obtained. Emissions for polymers and carbon black were calculated using
emission factors from a variety of sources including ELCD, DEFRA, and US-EIl 2.2 as
well as IPCC's AR5 GWP. Other purchased goods and services were calculated based
on spend information utilizing emission factors from CEDA.

Emissions calculation methodology
Avient utilizes our Scope 2 emissions and applies a regional transmission and
distribution loss % to calculate this value. T&D loss percentages for the USA are by
state and come from the EPA's "Power Profiler ZIP Code Tool with eGRID2018 Data"
version 9.0. Factors for the rest of the world come from the World Bank Table 5.11
"World Development Indicators: Power and communication" (2014 data).
