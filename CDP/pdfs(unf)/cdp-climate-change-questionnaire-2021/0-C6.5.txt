Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions from foundries and OSAT are calculated using scope 1 and 2 emissions collected from top suppliers. Emissions are allocated to AMD products from wafer
manufacturing and final assembly manufacturing using a manufacturing index to account for product complexity, size, and volume. Emissions from other vendors including
marketing, professional services, real estate, software providers, telecom and networking providers and other semiconductor manufacturing services are calculated
following a spend-based method.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or value chain partners
51
