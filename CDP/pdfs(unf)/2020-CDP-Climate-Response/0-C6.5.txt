Emissions calculation methodology
The climate change category of Purchased Goods and Services (PG and S) is
interpreted as the cradle-to-supplier-gate GWP impact of the representative raw material
inputs used to manufacture Owens Corning products. The data used to model these
impacts are from Owens Corning’s manufacturer-specific product LCA studies that have
been conducted. The scopes of the product LCAs are either cradle-to-grave or cradle-
to-gate; however, since the objective of this calculation only focuses on the activities
upstream of manufacturing, discernment between whether a given LCA is cradle-to-gate
or cradle-to-gate is not necessary. In each of these studies, GWP impact factors are
developed using the impact assessment results for the upstream life-cycle stages that
represent the input raw materials. The GWP impact data from the LCA studies are
combined and multiplied by the 2019 annual production volume of the appropriate
product manufactured by each of Owens Corning's three major businesses of insulation,
composites and roofing and asphalt.

Emissions calculation methodology
Determination of Scope 3 emissions associated with capital goods was performed using
an EIO-LCA based method and was calculated using the EIO-LCA on-line tool
developed by Carnegie Mellon University. Primary data was collected internally on
2019 total spend for capital expenditure. This was in the form of multiple SAP datasets
since Owens Corning's facilities use different versions of SAP. Each spend SAP
