CO. Introduction

CO.1

(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Mars has been proudly family owned for over 100 years. It’s this independence that gives us the gift of freedom to think in generations, not quarters, so
we can invest in the long-term future of our business, our people and the planet — all guided by our enduring Principles. We believe the world we want
tomorrow starts with how we do business today. Our bold ambitions must be matched with actions today from our more than 115,000 Associates in 80
countries around the world. Some of our current initiatives are:

e Investing $1 billion over the next several years to become sustainable in a generation
e Working to improve the wellbeing for families around the world
e Leveraging and sharing our research to create a better world for pets

Every day we are one step closer to the world we want tomorrow, through our steadfast commitment to action today.

Our business and the actions we take every day are founded on The Five Principles. They’re at the heart of everything we do, no matter what —
making sure we don't just talk about a better future, but work towards it every day.

Through our Sustainable in a Generation Plan, we aim to grow our business in ways that are good for people, good for the planet and good for our
business. The Plan sets new goals in three key areas: Healthy Planet, Thriving People and Nourishing Wellbeing. Within the Healthy Planet area, our
science-based Climate Action goal is to reduce the total GHG emissions across our value chain by 27% by 2025 and 67% by 2050 (from 2015
levels), in order to play our part to keep the planet from warming beyond two degrees.
