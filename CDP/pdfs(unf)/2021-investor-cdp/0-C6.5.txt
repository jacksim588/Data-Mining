Relevance of market-based Scope 2 emissions from this source (if applicable)

Explain why this source is excluded
Emissions from logistics are included in scope 3 due to 1. their relatively small amount (compared to kiln operations) and 2. methodological

issues (separating own fleet from third party transportation would be extremely data-intensive). This is in line with WBCSD-CSI guidance on
scope 3 emissions in the cement sector.
