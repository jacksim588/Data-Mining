board of directors. Through its subsidiary, Santam, Sanlam is also in the short-term insurance sector.

Sanlam currently provides a broad of range of financial solutions and products to retail (individual) and institutional clients: insurance, financial
planning, retirement, investment and wealth services. Sanlam is listed on both the JSE Limited and Namibian Securities Exchanges since 1998.

Sanlam commands both a local and global presence, with business interests located throughout South Africa, Africa, India, Malaysia, Australia,
UK/Ireland and the USA. Sanlam’s Head Office is located in Bellville near Cape Town.

countries in Africa.
