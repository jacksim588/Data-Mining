Relevance of market-based Scope 2 emissions from this source (if applicable)
Emissions are not relevant

Explain why this source is excluded
These spaces are allotted by the client per our service agreement in refineries, remote field locations or offshore platforms for our employees to
complete work assignments, temporary lodging or storage of samples. These spaces are typically for just one or two days, or up to a month,
and in rare cases longer in remote assignments in remote locations around the globe. In these spaces the facilities can be shared with other
contractors or client personnel and are temporary. Being part of the service agreements, we have no obligation to lease any of the spaces, pay
for electricity, or be responsible in any way. Due to the geographic distribution, small facility size, sharing of space, short duration and temporary
nature we consider contributions to GHG from our temporary field activities to be a negligible contribution to the total Scope 1 & 2 emissions.
Further, data from our client to calculate an accurate tones CQ2e is not available and often could not be separated from their total usages ina
given facility and may in fact be the client responsibility to report as part of their overall emission.
