Comment
The majority of operational GHG emissions stem from electricity consumption (Scope 2 emissions), contributing 68% to the operational GHG
emissions. In FY2018, the total electricity sourced from renewable sources was approximately 9% whereas in FY2019 it has increased to 15%.
For FY2019, the market-based Scope 2 emissions are 11,904 tCO2e, which were reduced by 6% from FY2018. The total energy consumption
in FY2019 across all sites, which is 43,695 MWH, has decreased approximately by 2% from the FY2018 consumption of 45,807 MWh. The
energy use across scope 1 and 2 is dominated by non-renewable electricity use, which contributes to 60% of the total FY2019 energy
consumption. The renewable electricity represents 9% of the total energy use in FY2019. A breakdown of emissions per division provides more
insights of the emission sources across Core Lab’s operations. Though there are more mid-level ATCs than ATCs they are only associated with
23% of the total operational emissions. Manufacturing sites had only 20% of total operational emissions, with no fugitive emissions from
refrigerant use at both sites and low natural gas and vehicle fuel consumption values.
Looking forward to 2020 and the current crude oil market downturn in activity along with business disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we
expect Scope 2 emissions to be lower and in line with our SBT's.
