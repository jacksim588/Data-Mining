Comment
Core Laboratories N.V. assesses its operational and value chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the WRI/WBCSD Corporate
Standard (Scope 1 and 2) Guidelines. In FY2019, Core Lab emitted 46,821 tCO2e of GHG emissions throughout its value chain. This
represents a decrease of 6% over 2018 emissions. During this same year the revenue increased by 42% and number of full-time employees
(FTEs) decreased by 8%. Scope 1 emissions have increased slightly due to an increase in fugitive emissions from refrigerant use, while overall
combined GHG emissions for scope 1 & 2 (location based) has decreased by 3%. The total operational GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2
location-based) for FY2019 are 15,176 tCO2e, approximately 57% of which is from the six ATCs. Scope 1 emissions contribute 32% of Scope
1 & 2, comprising 10% from vehicle fuel use, 13% from refrigerants (fugitive emissions) and remaining 9% from natural gas heating. While
refrigerants increased between 2018 to 2019 from 1,259 tCO2e to 1,917 tCO2e, due to the mechanical failure of a large chiller unit in the United
States, Natural gas heating (stationary energy) reduced from 1,677 tCO2e to 1,357 tCO2e, and Vehicle fuel use (mobile transport reduced from
1,605 tCO2e to 1,520 tCO2e. Looking forward to 2020 without the increase from refrigerants, and the current crude oil market downturn in
activity along with business disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect Scope 1 emissions to be lower significantly.
