DANFOSS CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2020 Tuesday, August 25, 2020

Explain why this source is excluded
The energy consumption is in most cases an integral part of the rent and therefore not
accounted for. We cannot estimate the emissions since we do not have access to utility
data.

(C6.5) Account for your organization’s gross global Scope 3 emissions, disclosing

Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions are estimated by Trucost.
Scope of the valuation: Present value of each metric tons of CO2e emitted now, taking
account of the full global cost of the damage that it imposes during its time in the
atmosphere. The social cost of carbon includes, but is not limited to, changes in net
agricultural productivity, human health, and property damages from increased flood risk.
Methodology approach: Trucost uses a social cost per metric tons of CO2e to value
GHG emissions, which is the value identified in the UK Government’s Stern Report
(Stern, 2006) as the central, business-as-usual scenario, adjusted for inflation to 2014
prices using a global weighted average consumer price index (CPI).

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
0

Please explain
