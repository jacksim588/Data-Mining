Welcome to your CDP Climate Change

CO. Introduction

CO.1

(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Fortum’s business activities cover the production and sales of electricity and heat, natural gas
sales, as well as energy-sector expert services and various customer solutions. Fortum is the
third largest power generator in Europe and Russia, the third largest producer of CO2-free
electricity in Europe, and a significant gas company.
In March 2020, Fortum closed transaction to become majority owner in Uniper. As the majority
owner with 75% of shares in Uniper, Fortum consolidates Uniper as a subsidiary as of 31
March 2020. Although Uniper is a subsidiary to Fortum, it still is a separate company, listed in
Germany, and therefore for now has its own sustainability processes, approach and standalone
sustainability reporting. As of the year 2020, Fortum’s reportable segments and reporting order
are the following: Generation, Russia, City Solutions, Consumer Solutions, and Uniper.
Fortum’s key markets are the Nordic countries, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, and India. With core operations in 14 countries, Fortum has
employed a diverse team of almost 20,000 energy-sector professionals in 2020. Fortum’s
power generation is mainly based on natural gas-fired generation and carbon dioxide-free
hydro and nuclear power. Fortum targets to reduce the share of coal in power generation
rapidly. A minor share of Fortum’s power generation is currently based on solar and wind, but
Fortum targets significant growth in the area over the next five years.
Fortum’s updated strategy is based on four strategic priorities: Transform own operations to
carbon neutral; Strengthen and grow in CO2-free power generation; Leverage strong position in
gas to enable the energy transition; Partner with industrial and infrastructure
customers. Fortum also updated its climate targets in December 2020, and Fortum is
committed to carbon neutrality (Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions), in line with the goals of the
Paris Agreement, by 2050 at the latest.
Fortum’s purpose is to drive the change for a cleaner world. Fortum wants to enable the energy
transition by providing customers and societies a reliable and affordable supply of low-carbon
energy and sustainable solutions. In the future, the energy system — and Fortum’s portfolio —
will be based on renewable energy, increasingly clean gas (e.g. hydrogen) and nuclear power.
In addition, Fortum offers industrial and infrastructure solutions, e.g., waste-to-energy, grid
stability services, as well as energy sales and storage. By improving the energy efficiency of
power and heat production, Fortum also reduces flue-gas emissions to the environment relative
to the produced energy and decrease production costs.
