Emissions calculation methodology
As the majority owner of Uniper, Fortum has consolidated Uniper as a subsidiary as of
31 March 2020. Sustainability indicators have been mainly consolidated as 75% of
Uniper's total figures in 2020, except direct CO2 emissions and energy production
volumes are consolidated as of 31 March 2020.
(i) The volumes and categories of purchased goods and services are based on Fortum's
procurement databases. Fortum, excluding Uniper, has assessed its Scope 3 emissions
based on GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard,
and emission data from EXIOBASE2 has been used in the calculation of emissions.
Uniper's purchased goods and services were classified according to DEFRA Product
Categories and multiplied by the corresponding emission factor (2017). The GWP
values are from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5), 100-year time horizon.
(ii) Fortum has assessed data quality based on criteria in Scope 3 standard on page 77
taking into account representativeness to the activity in terms of technology, time,
geography, completeness and reliability. Based on this Fortum has scored the quality of
primary and secondary data as very good/good/fair/poor. The data on spending of
purchases is relatively accurate (score: good). The biggest source of uncertainty in the
reported emissions is the emission factors (score: fair) for spending on different groups
of goods and services.
(iii) AS a part of the assessment, Fortum has estimated its GHG emissions from
purchased goods and services based on spend data from internal purchasing data
management systems. Fortum's purchased goods and services (other than capital
goods and energy and fuel related activities) consist mostly of maintenance and
construction and other business activities.
