Emissions calculation methodology
The emissions given in this line represent our GHG emissions related to externally sourced water. The emissions were calculated using
DEFRA/DECC 2018 emission factors for supplied water. These EF's were used on all water purchased by the different ICL companies (tap
water, well, river etc.). Quality of information is considered high, as most water figures are derived of primary data (invoices of water suppliers).
In the minority of cases, where no metering is conducted, the consumption was estimated by the relevant facility personnel. The assumption is
that these GHG emissions derive of electricity consumed in pumping and/or pre-treatment of the water by the suppliers. Other materials sourced
externally have been assessed as part of our product foot printing analyses in cooperation with our consultants and ICL's purchasing and
supply-chain departments. Our conclusion was that ICL did not have influence on potential reduction of emissions resulting from the
production/supply of these materials, and they were therefore excluded from our Scope 3 GHG inventory. This conclusion will be re-discussed
and assessed in coming years, in relation to the data received through ICL's increased sustainable procurement efforts- conducted as part of
the TFS initiative (see further details in chapter 12 of this report).
