Comment
Scope 2 includes emissions from energy purchased or acquired and consumed by the
reporting company. It includes the emissions from purchase electricity, steam, heat and
cooling. Scope 2 emission are considered an indirect emissions source (along with
Scope 3), because the emissions are a consequence of activities of the reporting
organization but actually occur at sources owned or controlled by another organization
(i.e. an electricity generator or utility).

In 2020, Suncor location-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated based on generic
emission factors (i.e. grid electricity emission factor, natural gas boiler steam generation
emission factor, and chilled water emission factor). Suncor market-based Scope 2
emissions are calculated by using supplier-specific emission factors for purchased
commodity, or determined by developing facility-specific methodology.
