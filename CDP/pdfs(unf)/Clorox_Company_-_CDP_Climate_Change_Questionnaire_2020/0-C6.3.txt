DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

(C6.2) Describe your organization’s approach to reporting Scope 2 emissions.

C6.3

Scope 2, location-based

We are reporting a Scope 2, location-based figure

Scope 2, market-based

We have no operations where we are able to access electricity supplier emission factors
or residual emissions factors and are unable to report a Scope 2, market-based figure

Comment

We continued efforts in 2019 to collect Scope 2 emissions in the U.S. using the market-
based method as stipulated by the GHG Protocol; however, we were unable to obtain
any contractual instruments or supplier specific emission rates, and residual mix factors
were not available for the markets in which Clorox operates. The impact of our Fairfield,
CA solar generation was immaterial to our overall consumption and retired RECS were
not available and as a result, our 2019 market-based Scope 2 emissions are identical to
our location-based emissions.

Comment

Scope 2 emissions are defined as Clorox's indirect emissions from purchased electricity,
heat and steam. 55 percent of our combined manufacturing and distribution GHG
footprint is from indirect electricity use at our manufacturing plants, distribution centers
and corporate office buildings. Our GHG calculations consider both the amount of
electricity drawn as well as the source of that electricity (coal, gas or other types of
power plant fuels). Regional electric power emission factors (eGRID data) were used to
compute indirect emissions. This conforms to the U.S. EPA Protocol and is consistent
with the location-based method of the GHG Protocol. We updated our baseline 2018
and use the location-based method for our goal setting and progress reporting.
