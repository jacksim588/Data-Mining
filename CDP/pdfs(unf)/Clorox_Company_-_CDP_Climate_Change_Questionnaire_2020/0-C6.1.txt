Comment
In 2019 we updated our baseline year from 2011 to 2018 and use the location-based
method for our goal setting and progress reporting. We did this because we have had a
significant number of acquisitions, divestitures since our prior baseline year in 2011.
The 2018 baseline was assured in calendar year 2019.
We continued efforts to collect Scope 2 emissions in the U.S. for 2018 using the market-
based method as stipulated by the GHG Protocol; however, we were unable to obtain
any contractual instruments or supplier specific emission rates, and residual mix factors
were not available for the markets in which Clorox operates. The impact of our Fairfield,
CA solar generation was immaterial to our overall consumption and retired RECS were
not available and as a result, our 2018 market-based Scope 2 emissions are identical to
our location-based emissions.
