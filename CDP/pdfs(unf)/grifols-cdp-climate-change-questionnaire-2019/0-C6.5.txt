Emissions calculation methodology
We have used the Life Cycle Assessment Methodology. We have calculated emissions
in production of glass and plastic that is the packaging of some of our final products: We
know the electricity consumption of packaging of 100 ml and 500 ml of PP and glass
material. We have the total units of production of PP and glass but not their
corresponding volume, so we have estimated that all units have 100 ml excepting those
ones that we are sure are 500 ml.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
0

Explanation
Grifols uses several raw materials from all over the world. So far we have only
calculated emissions related to primary packaging lifecycle, specifically glass vials and
plastic bags and bottles. It is included the packaging of all manufacturing plants.
