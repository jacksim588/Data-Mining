Comment
Please see note on page 66 of our 2018 Annual Report. We acquired ESCO in the
second half of 2018. ESCO divisions estimated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are
38212 tCO2e for the period July to Dec 2018. We have not included the ESCO division
within our 2018 reporting due as per our GHG Inventory Management Plan, which
states new acquisitions will be accounted from the first full financial period onwards; this
approach is in line with GHG Protocol principles.

process.
