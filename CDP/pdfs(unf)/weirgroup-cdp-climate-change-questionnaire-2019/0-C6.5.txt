DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION
Not relevant, explanation provided

Explanation
With a relatively low turnover rate of capital equipment, our global annual footprint is
driven primarily by operational GHG emissions rather than through the purchase of new
capital goods and the import of associated embodied carbon. Embodied carbon relating
to capital goods is therefore not considered relevant for total global GHG emissions
calculation.

Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)

Evaluation status
Relevant, not yet calculated

Explanation

Upstream transportation and distribution

Evaluation status
Relevant, not yet calculated

Explanation

Waste generated in operations

Evaluation status
Not relevant, explanation provided

Explanation
Weir produces waste through its operational processes and, in line with Lean principles,
continually seeks to reduce the quantities generated. A high proportion of the waste
generated is inert and therefore has low carbon emissions. Compared to the energy
intensity of the operations, carbon emissions from waste are expected to be insignificant
and therefore not relevant.

Business travel

Evaluation status
Not relevant, calculated

Metric tonnes CO2e
400.89

Emissions calculation methodology

Emissions from business travel have been calculated with regard to Group Executive
and Board meetings during 2018.

The method used to calculate emissions was:
Activity data x GHG emissions factor = GHG emissions value.
