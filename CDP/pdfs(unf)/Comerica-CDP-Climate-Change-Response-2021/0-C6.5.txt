Emissions calculation methodology
The lifecycle emissions calculated within this estimate include paper, computer and
carpeting emissions. (1) Paper: LCA-based emissions of office/marketing papers (4,758
MtCO2e) were calculated according to Environmental Paper Network Paper Calculator,
Version 4.0 using quantities of paper types purchased by Comerica, categorized
according to paper type (coated or uncoated free sheet) and percentage of post-
consumer recycle content. GWPs provided from the IPCC AR5-20 year (CO2=1,
CH4=102, N20=264). Lifecycle analysis and data quality documentation is provided at:
https://c.environmentalpaper.org/pdf/SCS-EPN-PC-Methods.pdf (2) Computers: LCA-
based emissions of desktops, notebooks, tablets, all-in-one computers and displays
(1,265 MtCO2e) were calculated based on product-specific information provided by
suppliers (Dell and Apple) and quantities of units purchased by Comerica (2,723
notebooks, 3 desktops, and 861 displays). Emission factors: notebook (299-512 kg
CO2e/unit), desktop (197-449 kg CO2e/unit), and displays (429-577 kg CO2e/unit). For
Dell LCA estimations, please refer to https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-

carbon-footprints.htm. For Apple lifecycle analysis estimations, please refer to

of carpet purchases (157 MtCO2e) were calculated based on product-specific
information provided by our main supplier and unit quantities purchased by Comerica
(9,531 yd2 carpet tile and vinyl tile). Emission factors: carpet tile emission factor (12.99
kg CO2e/yd2) for carpet tile brands and vinyl tile emission factors (34.98 to 53.73 kg
CO2e/yd2). Lifecycle analysis tests were performed by Shaw (using CML VLCA/TRACI
2.1 for carpet and GaBi 8.7, TRACI2.1 for vinyl flooring). Emissions provided represent
