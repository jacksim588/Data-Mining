Comment
We are reporting our Scope 2 Location-Based emissions and Scope 2 Market-Based
emission for 2020 activities. Currently, the only electricity supplier for our locations with
a known published utility-specific emission factor is Pacific Gas and Electric. Our
market-based emission factors are therefore calculated using the Pacific Gas and
Electric emission factor for the metered and estimated (unmetered) sites within the
Pacific Gas and Electric service territory, combined with residual emission mix factors
for sites not in the Pacific Gas and Electric service territory.
