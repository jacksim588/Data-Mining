Emissions calculation methodology
CSX reviewed annual spend from purchased goods and services and eliminated
purchased goods and services accounted for in other areas of the GHG Inventory.
Emissions were estimated using the WRIMWBCSD GHG Protocol Scope 3 Evaluator
Tool. The online tool is based on the Quantis Suite 2.0 software. The tool estimates
emissions in terms of expenditures in a given economic sector, using environmental
input-output datasets based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and the Open
10 Database. Since these supply chain emission estimates are rough approximations
based on simplified approaches, they will not be included in CSX's GHG Inventory. CSX
continues to work to understand emission sources in the supply chain.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
0

Please explain
Annual spend from purchased goods and services is obtained directly from CSX
Procurement group. It is important to note that emissions from purchased goods and
services are not included in CSX's GHG inventory because they are rough
approximations based on simplified approaches.
