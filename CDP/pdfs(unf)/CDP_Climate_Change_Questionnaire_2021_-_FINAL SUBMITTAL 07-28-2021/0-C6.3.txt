Comment
CSX’s Scope 2 location-based CO2, N20, and CH4 emissions from electricity are
quantified by multiplying the annual electricity usage by average emission rates.

Annual electricity usage (in kilowatt hour [KWH)]) and total annual spend on electricity
are obtained from a service provider hired by CSX to manage utilities. The electricity
usage data provided by this service provider includes all CSX companies. Emissions
factors for U.S. locations are obtained from U.S. EPA’s Emissions Generation Resource
Integrated Database (eGRID2019). The market-based emission factors are obtained
from Green-e Energy Residual Mix Emissions Rates (2020). In 2020, CSX procured
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for approximately 10% of its electricity usage.
These RECs were allocated evenly across the network in the U.S. and accounted for in
the market-based calculation. The Canadian GHG intensities are obtained from
Environment Canada, 2020 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity for the national level.
Scope 2 location-based emissions were independently verified.
