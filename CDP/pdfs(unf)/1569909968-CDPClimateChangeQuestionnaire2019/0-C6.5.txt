Emissions calculation methodology
In early 2019, a 2014 study undertaken to assess the pass-through carbon tax
implications in the South African Region was updated. The average data method was
used, whereby secondary emission factors for the manufacture of key carbon-intensive
process chemicals were used to determine the indirect carbon taxes likely to flow
through by virtue purchasing these commodities. Carbon costs in unit of local currency
(ZAR per tonne of CO2-e) were determined for each of the commodity, based on the
actual 2018 expenditure on these products. Thereafter the product of these carbon
costs and the annual value spent on each, provides a good estimate of the total indirect
carbon emissions from the purchase of these key commodities.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
0

Explanation
The 2018 assessment included the following key commodities: Ammonia, Lime, Caustic
Soda, Activated Carbon, Explosives, Sodium Cyanide, steel grinding media and
Services. The figures reported here are for goods and services procured in South Africa
only, which remains a material proportion of the AGA spend on similar goods and
services. We used industry averages and worked from our extensive knowledge of our
suppliers’ activities. Given the high carbon footprint of the South African electrical grid
(owing to coal-fired power stations), the data cannot be used to calculate equivalent
carbon emissions in our other countries of operations, particularly in those countries with
a high level of hydropower in the national energy mix, such as Brazil.

Explanation
As the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions are high (2.57 Mt in 2018), given our 2007
and 2008 carbon footprint exercise, it is expected that the relative scope 3 emissions
