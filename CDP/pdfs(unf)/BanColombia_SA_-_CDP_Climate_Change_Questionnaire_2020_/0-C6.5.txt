Emissions calculation methodology
Scope 3 GHG emissions for Purchased Goods And Services in Bancolombia are
currently associated with paper usage, the emissions factor used to estimate emissions
is 0.85 KgeqCo2/Kg of paper, obtained from Ecoinvent 2.2 - graphic paper, paper, wood
free, uncoated at integrated mill

Please explain
As a financial institution paper usage is a material issue included in the Bancolombia
Eco efficiency program. We have established a corporate emissions reduction target for
the 2020 for each of the countries where we have operational control. The target is to
reduce our 2010 Scope 3 emissions by 35% associated with paper consumption in our
Colombia Operations, 6% in our Panama Operations, 10% in our El Salvador
Operations and 4% in our Guatemala operations.
