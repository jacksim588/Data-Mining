Comment
Location Based Uncertainty:
Operating company purchases and sales (for resale) are from FERC Form 1 reports and
are considered high quality. Net purchases are converted to emissions using EPA's
eGRID 2016 regional emission rates.
Market Based Uncertainty:
Operating company purchases and sales (for resale) are from FERC Form 1 reports and
are considered high quality. Purchase Power Agreements from specific natural gas
sources have specific emission rates assigned to them. Purchase Power Agreements
for renewable sources (wind, solar and hydroelectric, net of REC sales) are removed
from the remaining purchases before applying EPA's eGRID 2016 regional emission
rates. Operating company specific emission rates are used to calculate sale-for-resale
emissions which are subtracted from emissions from purchased electricity for internal
use.

C6.3

(C6.3) What were your organization’s gross global Scope 2 emissions in metric tons
CO2e?

Reporting year

Scope 2, location-based
14,514,119

Scope 2, market-based (if applicable)
12,724,618

Comment
Location-based Scope 2 emissions use operating company net purchases (net of sale-
for-resale) and regional eGRID2016 CO2, CH4 and N20 emission rates (the most
current available). Market-based Scope 2 emissions account for dedicated renewable
purchases, specific PPAs, and operating company emission rates for sale-for-resale.

C6.4

(C6.4) Are there any sources (e.g. facilities, specific GHGs, activities, geographies,
etc.) of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions that are within your selected reporting
boundary which are not included in your disclosure?

Yes
