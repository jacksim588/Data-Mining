We calculated our market-based scope 2-emissions in 2015 for the first time based on
information of our suppliers. The supplier based information covers 94 % of our
electricity related scope 2-emissions and about 80 % of our steam demand. All emission
conversion factors have been implemented to our updated internal reporting system
"SuRe2.0 System" since mid of 2016.
