Arcadis CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2020 22 August 2020 Ww DP

DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

Purchased goods and services

Evaluation status
Not relevant, explanation provided

Please explain
In 2015, we have performed a materiality of our entire value chain scope 3 sources for
our Dutch OpCo. Examples of a few upstream emissions that were analyzed are:
purchases of goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation, and
distribution, downstream we analyzed usage of our sold product (reports), end-of-life of
sold products, investments, etc.
Based on that analysis, our supplier purchases are material to Arcadis but the usage is
limited. Our main purchase for goods and service is that of office paper. The usage of
paper is considered immaterial as it was calculated to be less than 1% emission of our
total footprint.
Arcadis’ other OpCos have similar usage patterns, and therefore the results of this
analyses can be extrapolated to other regions of Arcadis as the type of service we
deliver is very similar.

Capital goods

Evaluation status
Not relevant, explanation provided

Please explain
In 2015, we have performed a materiality of our entire value chain scope 3 sources for
our Dutch OpCo. The purchase of capital goods for Arcadis Netherlands, and other
regions is negligible as we often lease our office space.
Based on that analysis our capital goods were considered immaterial. The results of this
analyses can be extrapolated to other regions of Arcadis as the type of service we
deliver is very similar.
