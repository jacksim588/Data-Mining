Comment
Arcadis updated our reporting systems we have changed our Natural gas consumption
reporting from reporting these emissions under scope 3 to reporting these emissions
under scope 1, which was mis-classified. Natural gas consumption, compared to our
total calculated CO2 emissions, accounts for less than 2%. It accounts ~10% of our
scope 1 emissions.
