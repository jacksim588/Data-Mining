DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

account for the emissions associated with this source. ASELSAN does not predict the
full inclusion over a five years period.

Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)

Evaluation status
Not relevant, explanation provided

Explanation
In the next two years we are planning to obtain data by: Reference to the scope 1 GHG
inventory, including sources and types of fuels consumed and collect data from the fuel
procurement department. If necessary, collect data from fuel suppliers; and/or reference
to life cycle databases and/or GHG Protocol website.

Upstream transportation and distribution

Evaluation status
Relevant, calculated

Metric tonnes CO2e
13.09

Emissions calculation methodology
DEFRA: Freighting goods-2018

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners

Explanation
This data is provided from our main chemical material suppliers who transport chemicals
inside our Macunk6y Facility by using roadway. The great majority of this
transportation's GHG gases comprise CO2 from exhaust emissions (fuel usage). We
are planning to have a clear climate change related procurement policy to measure and
reduce CO2 emissions generated from upstream transportation of chemicals The
verification of this category is fulfilled by the 3rd party audit for 2018 activities.

Waste generated in operations

Evaluation status
Relevant, calculated

Metric tonnes CO2e
226.88

Emissions calculation methodology
The assessment and the data gathering process is in place. Waste generated in
operations is calculated based on Defra 2018 methodology on waste disposal. Waste
water generated from operations is calculated based on Defra 2018 methodology on
water treatment
