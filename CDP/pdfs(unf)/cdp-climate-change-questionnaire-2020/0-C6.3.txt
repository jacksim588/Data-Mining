an onerous process and to date only one such permission has been given in South
Africa. As such market-based electricity is not yet readily available in South Africa.

Comment
Actual scope 2 emissions (location based) have been calculated and rounded off.
Market-based emissions are not applicable to Kumba’s operations as all electricity has
to be purchased from the Eskom, South Africa’s electricity utility. Any independent
power producer that applies for generation licence for the sale of electricity to private
sector buyers must get approval from the Minister of Energy. This approval covers the
deviation from the integrated resource plan (IRP) published by the government.
This is an onerous process and to date only one such permission has been given in
South Africa. As such market-based electricity is not yet readily available in South
Africa.
