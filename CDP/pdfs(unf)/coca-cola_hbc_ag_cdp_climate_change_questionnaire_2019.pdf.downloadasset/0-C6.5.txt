Emissions calculation methodology
In calculation included are: Ingredients and Pack materials (including secondary
packaging) purchased for all our operations. We multiply the quantity of purchased
material by the respective ingredients/packaging GHG emissions factor. We use
Ecoinvent Database, also for some of the factors we use IFEU LCA assigned by The
Coca- Cola Company. For Tetrapak material we use supplier database for calculating of
the CO2 factor.In 2018 we started including also emissions from Juice concentrates.
Baseline year 2010 and also 2015, 2016 and 2017 years have been recalculated.

we use supplier database

Capital goods

Evaluation status
Not relevant, explanation provided

Explanation
Capital equipment includes many mainly metallic vessels, pipework and automated
packaging solutions. Unitary GHG data from equipment manufacturers is not available
for the time being. We evaluated it and our high level calculations showed that this
category is below the threshold for reporting of Scope 3 emissions therefore we do not
report it in 2018. We plan to re-evaluate this in the coming years.
