Emissions calculation methodology
Location -based emissions from electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) losses
were calculated by multiplying electricity consumption (international facilities) or
electricity emissions (US facilities) by the T&D loss rate in accordance with the GHG
Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and the
GHG Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (Version 1.0).
Emission factors for the US are from US EPA, "Year 2016 Summary Tables", Table 1
Subregion Output Emission Rates (eGRID2016), February 2018. GWPs from the IPCC
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 - 100 year) were applied. T&D loss rates for the US are
from US Energy Information Administration (EIA), "State Electricity Profiles," Table 10.
Supply and disposition of electricity, 1990-2017 (megawatthours), Data for 2017,
February 26, 2019 (https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/), and international T&D loss
rates are from the International Energy Agency (IEA), “CO2 Emissions from Fuel
Combustion,” 2018 Edition, Year 2016 Data.

Emissions calculation methodology
Solid waste emissions (hazardous and non-hazardous waste to landfill, recycling) were
calculated by multiplying the mass of waste by the appropriate emission factor (EF)
based on the waste treatment method and waste type. Hazardous waste was assumed
to be general hazardous waste sent to landfill, non-hazardous waste to landfill was
assumed to be mixed municipal solid waste (MSW), and potential waste material
