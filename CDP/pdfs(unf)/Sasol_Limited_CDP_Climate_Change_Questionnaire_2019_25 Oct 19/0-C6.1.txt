(C6.2) Describe your organization’s approach to reporting Scope 2 emissions.
Row 1

Scope 2, location-based
We are reporting a Scope 2, location-based figure

Scope 2, market-based
We have no operations where we are able to access electricity supplier emission factors
or residual emissions factors and are unable to report a Scope 2, market-based figure

Comment
Sasol currently reports its Scope 2 emissions as location-based Scope 2 figures. We
have not embarked on a project to quantify these yet but intend to assess the viability of
doing so.
