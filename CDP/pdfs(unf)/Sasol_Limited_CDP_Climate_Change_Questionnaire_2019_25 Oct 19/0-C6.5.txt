Emissions calculation methodology
Sasol estimated emissions associated with selected and material purchased goods and
services. This includes purchased potable water, natural gas, crude oil, coal and white
product (refined fuel that Sasol purchases and sells) with an assumption that 40% is
diesel and the other remaining 60% is petrol). Activity data is attributed on an
operational control basis. This activity data is multiplied by the appropriate emission
factor. Calculation of the carbon footprint complies with the criteria of the ISO-14064
part 1 Standard and GHG Protocol —Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Accounting and
Reporting Standard. The following DEFRA 2018 emission factors were used: water
treatment - 0.708 kg CO2e/m3; water supply - 0.344 kg CO2e/m3., Natural Gas - 0,2845
