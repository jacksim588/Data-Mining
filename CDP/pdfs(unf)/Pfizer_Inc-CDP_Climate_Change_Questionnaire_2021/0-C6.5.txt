Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions calculated based on 2020 spend data. Spend data is extracted from Pfizer's
accounting system by category (i.e., SAP and E1). Spend associated with purchased
goods and services with an associated GHG footprint is segregated by product or
service type and multiplied by the most appropriate emission factor to estimate
emissions (CO2e). Spend not considered to have a significant Scope 3 GHG footprint
(e.g., colleague wages, customer rebates, taxes, etc.) were excluded from the
calculation. Two sets of emission factors were used: 1. emission factors estimated by an
outside consultant (ERM) using average data-methodology which estimates emissions
by collecting data on the mass (e.g. kilogram or pounds), or other relevant units of
goods or services purchased and multiplying by the relevant secondary emission factors
(e.g. industry average cradle-to-gate life cycle data for the production of products); and
2. DEFRA 2011 Table 13 Emission Factors adjusted to 2020 for inflation.
