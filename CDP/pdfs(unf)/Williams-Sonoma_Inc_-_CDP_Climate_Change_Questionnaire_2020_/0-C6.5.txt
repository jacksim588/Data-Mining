Emissions calculation methodology
PG&S was split into Indirect (non-retail) and Direct (retail) procurement categories in the
inventory.
Indirect procurement approach: FY2019 indirect soend data was mapped to Carnegie
Mellon EEIO factors to calculate associated emissions.
Product footprint approach: FY2019 product SKU procurement data, including some
textile and wood material data at the SKU level, were used with a hybrid material and
product LCA approach to calculate emissions. Emissions Factors used: SAC Higg MSI,
Ecoinvent, and 31 product LCA studies
We organized the product hierarchy using Department and Class categorizations to
group products — then broke the inventory into two approaches: Material LCA (higher
priority) & Representative Product LCA (secondary priority)
Material LCA approach: We compared the Fiber material and Wood material files to the
full product inventory to identify which products we could apply a material LCA to (Only
products which were primarily composed of the listed material(s) would quality for the
material LCA method).
Representative Product LCA approach: For all products without available material
weight/volume information, we mapped LCA study factors to similar sets of products.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
42

Please explain
PG&S emissions are comprised of 89% product-based and 11% indirect-spend
calculated emissions. WSI collects material data for all wood-based and textile products
from suppliers and material LCAs were used to calculate our emissions using this
supplier data, accounting for 42% of the total emissions in this category.
