DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

Comment
Our electricity consumption is not a material part of Euronav's operations. In 2019, no
supplier specific tariffs or REGO backed purchases were made to cover this
consumption. Therefore, market-based emissions factors are currently not relevant for
Euronav's emissions accounting, however these have been calculated with residual
factors for transparency.
