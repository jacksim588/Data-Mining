CO. Introduction

CO.1

(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Euronav is an international shipping company storing and transporting crude oil with 72 vessels
(with four new VLCC due for delivery in late 2020/early 2021) and a total of 200 full time
onshore employees with a further 2,700 contractors (crew) worldwide. Euronav is committed to
achieving and maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, social responsibility
and environmental stewardship in the crude oil sector. As a supplier of freighting services,
Euronav is strongly affected by the market supply and demand for crude oil, as well as the
global availability of crude tankers. As a consequence of significant market competition from
other tanker providers in a tight marketplace, Euronav has a strong tradition of maintaining best
in class operational performance in its vessels. This focus on fuel efficiency has led Euronav to
engage with its supply chain to ensure only the cleanest, most efficient vessels are
incorporated into its fleet, and a rigorous maintenance regime implemented to ensure ongoing
and improving operational efficiency.
