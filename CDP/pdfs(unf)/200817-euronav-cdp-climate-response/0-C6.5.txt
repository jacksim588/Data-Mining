DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

Explain why this source is excluded
Emissions from these one-person offices are extremely immaterial in comparison to
Euronav’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Total office emissions make up 0.029% of
Euronav’s emissions, therefore these sources have no discernible impact on the final
figures, and are not relevant to Euronav’s emissions disclosure.

Emissions calculation methodology
Using the activity data from our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we applied relevant
emissions factors from the latest conversion factor datasets available to calculate the
emissions generated upstream through Well-to-Tank production, processing and
delivery of fuel and Transmission and Distribution losses of electricity. To calculate the
indirect emissions of our fuel consumption and business travel, we applied emission
factors from the UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting
2019, published by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of
UK). Upstream emissions arising from electricity consumption were calculated using
country-specific DEFRA 2019 emission factors for the Well-to-Tank emissions and Well-
to-Tank emissions associated with the Transmission and Distribution losses of getting
electricity to the end user. The country breakdown of emissions factors for Transmission
