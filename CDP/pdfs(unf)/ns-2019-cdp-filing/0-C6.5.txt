Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions were calculated based on the hybrid method as outlined in the GHG
Protocol’s Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. Locomotives are the
primary capital goods acquired by Norfolk Southern Railway. Accordingly, GHG
emissions and other data was requested from GE, our principal locomotive supplier. The
data received from the suppliers was used to calculate Norfolk Southern’s GHG
emissions from capital goods. For data that was not provided by suppliers, an average
numerical value was used in estimating GHG emissions. Emissions for capital goods
were calculated using volumes of key purchased goods by type of material applied
against applicable emission factors from the IPCC.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or
value chain partners
50

Explanation
This year, we obtained data on locomotives supplied to Norfolk Sothern from GE
Transportation. GE is Norfolk Southern’s primary locomotive supplier. We also obtained
data from our suppliers of rails, ballasts, and ties.
