C6.2

(C6.2) Describe your organization’s approach to reporting Scope 2 emissions.

Row 1

Scope 2, location-based
We are reporting a Scope 2, location-based figure

Scope 2, market-based

We have operations where we are able to access electricity supplier emission factors or
residual emissions factors, but are unable to report a Scope 2, market-based figure

Comment

Air Products has chosen not to report a market-based figure because it would disclose
confidential business information. As reported in our 2019 Sustainability Report, the
majority of the renewable electricity we purchase is used in France to make merchant
industrial and medical gases. Reporting market-based Scope 2 emissions would provide
insight into the energy consumed in France, which is considered confidential as it can
be directly correlated to production.
