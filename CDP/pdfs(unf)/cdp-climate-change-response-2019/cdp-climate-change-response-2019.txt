CO. Introduction

CO.1

(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Air Products (NYSE:APD) serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products,
services and solutions that include atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare
gases), process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, syngas) and
specialty gases, and equipment and services relating to the production or processing of gases.
The company serves customers in many industries, including refining, chemical, gasification,
metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. For over 75 years, the company
has enabled its customers to become more productive, energy efficient and sustainable. With
fiscal 2018 annual revenues of $8.9 billion, operations in more than 50 countries*, and more
than 16,000 employees, we strive to build lasting relationships with our customers and
communities based on understanding, integrity and passion. Corporate headquarters are
located in eastern Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, near Allentown; European headquarters are at
Hersham, near London, England; South American headquarters are located in Santiago, Chile;
and Asian headquarters are in Shanghai, China.

We are focused on delivering technologies and solutions that contribute to cleaner air, energy
efficiency improvements, and safer products for our customers and the communities where we
live and operate. In bringing these unique capabilities and real answers to market problems,
our commitment to protect the environment has never wavered.

From our leading position supplying hydrogen to refineries to make low-sulfur, cleaner burning
fuels; to large-scale oxygen systems for solid fuel combustion and gasification; to delivery
systems that support the hydrogen economy, we continue to invest in R&D to develop products
and processes that contribute to cleaner air and greenhouse gas mitigation. In 2018, we
estimate that our products enabled customers and downstream users to avoid 55 million metric
tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions—equivalent to the emissions from 12 million cars
and almost double our own direct and indirect CO2 emissions.

We are committed to improving our environmental performance by operating efficiently.
Industrial gas manufacturing is energy intensive. Air separation units require electricity or steam
to compress air so that it can be cryogenically distilled into oxygen, nitrogen and argon.
Likewise, the production of hydrogen consumes natural gas, and in some cases, refinery off-
gas as a feedstock and as a fuel in the production process. The vast majority of our Scope 1
emissions are related to hydrogen production, while our Scope 2 emissions are due in large
part to the electricity and steam we consume for air separation. Our Scope 3 emissions are
related primarily to the fuels we consume, business travel and our investments. We are
