DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

C6.5

(C6.5) Account for your organization’s Scope 3 emissions, disclosing and explaining
any exclusions.

Purchased goods and services

Evaluation status
Relevant, not yet calculated

Explanation
The principal raw materials for making atmospheric gases and hydrogen are air, energy
as electricity or steam, and natural gas. The amount of natural gas consumed as a
feedstock is considered company confidential, therefore Scope 3 emissions related to
purchased goods and services are not disclosed.

Capital goods

Evaluation status
Relevant, not yet calculated

Explanation
Air Products' equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries,
including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and
processing, and steel and primary metals processing. While we expect that Scope 3
emissions related to the materials used to make this equipment may be relevant, the
emissions cannot be reliably estimated.

Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)

Evaluation status
Relevant, calculated

Metric tonnes CO2e
4,000,000

Emissions calculation methodology
The amount of fuel was determined primarily from invoice-quality data. The consumption
quantities were grouped based on the region of consumption. Cradle-to-gate emissions
factors for the production of each fuel type were obtained from life-cycle assessment
databases. For each fuel type, the amount consumed was multiplied by the fuel’s
cradle-to-gate emissions factor specific to the respective regions to calculate the
individual emissions that were subsequently summed to the total emissions amount. For
electricity consumption, the fuel types and the amount of each were determined based
on regional grid mixes, heat rates for respective fuel-type power plants and heating
value of fuel types. Fuel for electricity was adjusted to account for the transmission and
distribution losses for the regions as per data from World Development Indicators.
