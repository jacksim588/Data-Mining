Emissions calculation methodology
Ecolab has used Environmentally Extended Economic Input Output (EEIO) analysis for
a portion of its annual supplier and procurement spend data. This is a categorization
model to convert $USD spend based on relevant NAICS sector categories into carbon
emissions associated with the extraction, production and transport of purchased goods
and services acquired or purchased by Ecolab in the reported year. We have evaluated
100% of the spend in our three most material supplier categories: Raw Material
Chemical suppliers, Packaging suppliers and Equipment suppliers. For each, we have
incorporated 100% of the global spend data for 2018 and years prior to enable year-on-
year comparison). In total, this represents more than 50% of our total global supplier
spend and corresponding Purchased Goods and Services related emissions.
